# Welcome to Jiuhe's Profile

## Life

Hi, I current live in Hong Kong with my family. I love traveling, however, because of Covid-19, I haven't taken a long trip for almost 2 years.

Can't wait to go around the world again.

## Work

I'm a machine learning platform engineer.

I've got experience and interests in machine learning training, serving, logging and monitoring. Yeah, almost the whole combo.
